        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">General principles of the staff transfer process: information for exporting managers</h1>
<p class="govuk-body-l">This page explains the details for exporting managers behind the staff transfer process.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">All civil servants recruited through <a href="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/" class="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/">fair and open competition</a> can apply for, or be considered for a staff transfer on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a level grade</li>
<li>a lower grade</li>
<li>promotion</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Also eligible to apply:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>employees in crown non-departmental public bodies</li>
<li>employees in accredited non-crown, non-departmental public bodies (accredited by the Civil Service Commission)</li>
<li>employees transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) and the Scottish and Welsh governments.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If employees are not sure they are eligible to transfer, they should contact their HR Business Partner.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees transferring to the NICS should contact the vacancy holder to check if they will honour their continuous service.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="probation">Probationary period</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If employees are on a probationary period, the job advert should clarify their eligibility to transfer.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="employee_transfer">The employee’s transfer</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees should understand the terms of their transfer in full, including any effect on their:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>allowances</li>
<li>annual leave allowance</li>
<li>entitlement to occupational maternity/paternity pay</li>
<li>payments into any childcare voucher scheme</li>
<li>pension contributions</li>
<li>performance award/bonus</li>
<li>salary</li>
<li>terms and conditions of employment</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive. As the exporting line manager you should support the employee with their understanding of their transfer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees should refer to the job advert or check with their vacancy holder for more details about terms and conditions. The employee’s current department will pay the employee until their last working day with them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees should also check how their performance award/bonus will be paid if this applies. They should speak to you, then their new manager to find out.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees will get an employment contract on or before their start date. If they do not, they should contact their new line manager. Employees keep employment rights related to length of service. For example, their annual leave and pension.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="pre-employment">Pre-employment checks</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">All staff transferring from other departments undergo some pre-employment checks. These are known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard">Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</a> checks. Some departments also refer to them as ‘basic’ or ‘baseline’ checks.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They help departments follow legislation to provide evidence of right to work, including:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>right to work in the UK</li>
<li>right to work in the Civil Service</li>
<li>the employee’s nationality and immigration status</li>
<li>an identity check</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Basic, standard or enhanced criminal record checks may be needed. Depending on the employee’s new role, they may need additional checks, for example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>relationships with current prisoners</li>
<li>safeguarding checks to work with children or vulnerable adults</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">The job advert should confirm the level of checking needed for the role. If the employee is not sure,they should check with the vacancy holder.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="nsv">National Security Vetting (NSV)</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">In addition to BPSS checks, some roles need National Security Vetting (NSV), sometimes called security clearance:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)</li>
<li>Security Check (SC)</li>
<li>enhanced Security Check (eSC)</li>
<li>Developed Vetting (DV)</li>
<li>enhanced Developed Vetting (eDV)</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">These are mandatory for certain job roles and locations. If the employee holds a National Security Vetting (NSV) clearance level or needs one for their new role, this is part of their transfer. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> explains the different levels in detail.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">NSV sits with the employee, not their role.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee has a valid NSV, it will be transferable if the expiry date is longer than 3 months. This is unless there is a risk flag or issue with the transfer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee will be told if the transfer of their NSV will take more than 7 days. For example, active <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-national-security-vetting-aftercare-information" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-national-security-vetting-aftercare-information">aftercare</a> is present or NSV is not found.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee should always complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form. They should only complete the NSV section if:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>their new role needs NSV - regardless of their current clearance level</li>
<li>they have valid NSV clearance - regardless of level, even if their new role does not need NSV clearance</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If the employee transfers to a role with the same level of NSV or higher</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee has clearance at the same level or higher it will normally transfer to their new department. The new department is responsible for the transfer of NSV. They will ask the employee:</p>	
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>about the transfer of their clearance (if it applies)</li>
<li>to complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee does not have the same or higher level of NSV, they will need a new NSV check. You cannot agree on their start date until after this is done.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To find out more the employee can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>ask the vacancy holder</li>
<li>check the job advert</li>
<li>contact their vetting authority/cluster security unit</li>
<li>check their department’s intranet for more information</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="workplace_adjustments">Workplace adjustments<h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Workplace adjustments are changes to remove or reduce disadvantages in the workplace. They can be physical or non-physical changes to help employees. They are sometimes known as reasonable adjustments. Any agreed adjustments should be recorded in a Workplace Adjustment Passport. This should be up-to-date and agreed.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">An employee’s workplace adjustments might be known as ‘hard’ adjustments. For example, a chair, desk, or specialist computer software. ‘Soft’ adjustments may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>changes to the employee’s start and finish times</li>
<li>how they are allowed travel to, from and for work</li>
<li>large print, braille or other formatting changes</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If the employee has hard adjustments</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You will need to decide which hard adjustments <strong>can</strong> transfer to the employee’s new department.</p>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example:</h4>
A specialist chair should be moved by courier instead of the new department ordering a new one. Consider the cost effectiveness of moving the chair, rather than buying a new one. Especially if the chair is specific to one employee. The importing department should pay the cost of moving the item. They are saving the cost of having to buy new.
</div>
<p class="govuk-body">Smaller items should be moved or replaced depending on cost and wear and tear. For example, a special footrest or keyboard/mouse.</p>	
<p class="govuk-body">You also need to decide which of the hard adjustments <strong>cannot</strong> transfer with the employee. You will need to discuss these with the importing manager so they are aware of any hard adjustments they need to buy.</p>
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1:</h4>
Moving a desk might prove less cost effective than buying a similar desk in the new department. It might not fit the desk configurations in the new location. It is also possible there might already be a suitable desk at the new location.
</div>	
        <div class="govuk-inset-text">
          <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 2:</h4>
The employee’s laptop with specialist software might not be compatible with their new department’s IT.
</div>	
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">If the employee has soft adjustments</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The new line manager will need to understand any soft adjustments the member of staff has in place, and how they transfer. The employee must be included in these discussions and give permission for details to be shared.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Remember, some items may have longer lead times if they have to be bought new. The importing manager should agree with the employee if they can start without them, or delay their start date until the items are in place.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Carer's Passport<h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The need to re-negotiate flexibilities contained in an employee's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-passport" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/carers-passport">Carer’s Passport</a> should be minimised when they transfer between departments.</p>	
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="systems_and_processes">Systems and processes</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The current department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The exporting department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>following the process and providing accurate information to the employee’s new department with one calendar month notice. This allows for their transfer with minimal disruption to the employee and department</li>
<li>releasing the employee to their new role within 4-8 weeks. Excluding time taken to complete any vetting needed</li>
<li>paying the employee until the day before they transfer</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If their transfer date is the first of the month, this should avoid any overpayments. These include non-recoverable aspects, for example increased:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>student loan payments</li>
<li>pension payments</li>
<li>National Insurance payments</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">The new department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The new department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>completing the employee's pre-employment checks</li>
  <li>transferring any valid security clearance</li>
  <li>completing a new security clearance request if needed</li>
  <li>making sure the employee has a staff number and start date</li>
  <li>setting up the employee's HR record and paying them from their start date</li>
  <li>keeping in contact with the employee during the transfer process</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="loans">Loans</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body"><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/loans-policy-combined-hr-and-finance-policy-and-process" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/loans-policy-combined-hr-and-finance-policy-and-process">The loans policy guidance</a> explains both the HR and financial implications to make decisions on loans easier for everyone. It includes details for loans of more than 6 months, and short term loans where there is no movement of payroll. If you or your employee have further queries about loans, contact your HR team or HR business partner.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">In this section, the definitions are:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>Host: the department whom the employee is on loan to</li> 
<li>Home: means the department the employee is on loan from</li>
<li>New department: any external department/government organisation. It does not mean the host or home department</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">When the staff transfer process applies to loans</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">The staff transfer process applies for a loan of more than 6 months and when the employee returns to their home department.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The process also applies to all short term loans of less than 6 months that convert into either:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>a long term loan</li>
    <li>a permanent transfer (level transfer or promotion)</li>
  </ul> 
<p cass="govuk-body">The home department completes Parts B and C of the staff transfer form.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Loan examples</h4>
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
   <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1: Completion of loan over 6 months. Return to home department</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The employee should complete the staff transfer form, stating that this is a return from loan.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The host department completes Parts B and C of the staff transfer form. They should do this to avoid an overpayment.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">If security clearance is transferred for the loan, it needs to return to the host department. Use Part A-1 of the staff transfer form to do this.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The home department should confirm the employee’s salary upon return.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The host department removes the employee from their payroll. This will be 1 calendar day before the employee's start date back at their home department.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">At least 4 weeks notice should be given before the start date. The transfer date should take into account payroll cut-off dates of both departments.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The home department will:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>add the employee to payroll from their start date</li>
      <li>reinstate the employee if the payroll is frozen</li>
      <li>take into account any changes in salary</li>
  </ul>
</div> 
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
   <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 2: Employee moves to new department during a loan of more than 6 months</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The home department removes any end of loan date from their HR/ payroll system. They will end the employee’s record if applicable. The employee’s move is not to a host or their home department. The employee follows the staff transfer process.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The host department completes Parts B and C of the staff transfer form. They notify the home department of the employee’s permanent transfer to another government organisation.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The home department removes any end of loan date from their HR/ payroll system. They will end the employee’s record if applicable.</p>
</div> 
  <div class="govuk-inset-text">
   <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 3: Employee moves to new department during a loan of less than 6 months</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The employee’s move is not to a host or their home department. The employee follows the staff transfer process.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The home department completes Parts B and C of the staff transfer form.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The home department removes any end of loan date from their HR/ payroll system.</p>
</div>
 <h4 class="govuk-heading-m">When the staff transfer process does not apply</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">The staff transfer process does <strong>not</strong> apply when:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>an employee stays permanently at a department they are on loan to if this is a loan of more than 6 months and staff transfer is already completed</li>
  <li>short term loan of less than 6 months</li>
  </li>employees leave the Civil Service while on loan</li>
</ul>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
     <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 4: Employee stays at host department - permanent level transfer or promotion after more than 6 months on loan</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The staff transfer process is not needed because there is no payroll transfer. The host department follows their internal guidance and converts the employee to permanent status. This may happen as a managed move or through a recruitment process.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The host department notifies the home department of the permanent transfer. This is for the home department to remove any potential end date of loan from their HR/ payroll system. The employee’s record terminates (if applicable).</p>
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
     <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 5: Leaving the Civil Service during a loan of more than 6 months</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The employee follows their host department’s normal termination process. The employee should refer to their host department’s intranet for guidance.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The host department tells the home department the employee has resigned. The home department terminates the employee’s record if required.</p>
      </div>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="pay">Pay and allowances</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">The new department makes sure pay and allowances are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>clear in job adverts</li>
  <li>agreed</li>
  <li>recorded on time so the HR record can be set up</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">If the employee is transferring permanently, or on a loan of more than 6 months, their new department’s pay and reward policies will apply. Individual departments are responsible for pay decisions. Loans of less than 6 months do not transfer payroll.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The current department will pay an employee’s salary until the date of transfer. If the employee’s first day in the new department is a Monday then their last day of service will be a Sunday. The new department will pay the employee from their first working day in their new role.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Level transfers</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">Basic pay in level transfers usually stays the same. It excludes:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
  <li>location allowances</li>
  <li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To help you support transferring employees, there are level transfer examples included in the guidance for employees.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Promotion</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If an employee transfers on promotion, the new department will work out the basic pay for their new grade.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Existing civil servants who gain promotion may:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>move to the bottom of the new grade pay scale</li>
<li>receive a per cent increase in basic pay</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">whichever would be greater. The new department will confirm the basic pay per cent increase.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">To help you support transferring employees, there are promotion examples included in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies">guidance for employees</a>.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Allowances</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">Allowances are not automatically kept when employees transfer or move on loan to a new department. The new department decides on payable allowances following transfer.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The new department will make sure the job advert states relevant allowances for the role.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">To help you support transferring employees, details are included in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies">guidance for employees</a>.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="performance_awards">Performance awards</h3>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">End of year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">Entitlement depends on the transfer date to the employee’s new department.</p>  
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1: An employee transfers after the old department’s settlement date</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The old department will honour the payment. Departments keep payroll open for 6 months after transfers. This is so they can process any outstanding payments. Employees should not receive two awards for the same performance period.</p>
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 2: An employee transfers before both department’s settlement dates. This is after the end of the performance year</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">If it is not possible or practical for the old department to pay an employee’s performance award, the expectation is that the new department will honour the payment</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">In-year awards should be paid before employees transfer from their old department. Either as a voucher or cash award.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">If this is not possible, the old department should pay in-year awards to employees within 3 months of the award date. 
  <p cass="govuk-body">There should be no reason to transfer the liability to the new department.</p>
