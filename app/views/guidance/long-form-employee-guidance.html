        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="who">Who does the staff transfer process apply to?</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">It applies to civil servants who are moving between:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>departments</li>
<li>armâ€™s length bodies (ALBs)</li>
<li>non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) employing civil servants</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">and civil servants:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)</li>
  <li>whose original appointment was on merit and by fair and open competition.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how">How do I transfer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">You will get an email confirming your provisional job offer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You should then complete the <a href="#" class="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/997207/Civil_Service_Employee_Transfer_Form__9.xlsx">staff transfer form</a>. This is otherwise known as the Civil Service Employee Transfer (CSET) form. It covers HR, payroll and security clearance transfer. Your line manager and HR/shared services also have sections of the form to complete.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Exceptions</h2>     
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer form is mandatory except for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>machinery of government changes</li>
  <li>Cabinet Office statement of practice (COSOP) moves</li>
  <li>if a NDPB employs public servants or you are a public servant</li>
  <li>loans of less than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="NSV">National Security Vetting (NSV)</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you hold a National Security Vetting (NSV) clearance level or you need one for your new role, this is part of your transfer process.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">NSV is sometimes called security clearance. It sits with you, not your role.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you have a valid NSV, it will be transferable if the expiry date is longer than 3 months, unless there is:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a risk flag</li>
  <li>an issue with the transfer</li>
</ul>
      <p class="govuk-body">You will be told if the transfer of your NSV will take more than 7 days. For example:</p>
           <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>active after care is present</li>
  <li>NSV is not found</li>
</ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">You should <strong>always</strong> complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form. Only complete the NSV section if:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your new role needs NSV - regardless of your current clearance</li>
  <li>you have valid NSV clearance - regardless of level, even if your new role does not need NSV clearance</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pre-employment checks</h2>
           <p class="govuk-body">Your new role may need you to have pre-employment checks. This could include checks on:</p>
                   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard">Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</a></li>
  <li>relationships with current prisoners</li>
  <li>safeguarding checks to work with children or vulnerable adults</li>

<p class="govuk-body">If you are on a probationary period, the job advert should clarify eligibility to transfer. If you are not sure if you are eligible, contact your HR Business Partner.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees transferring to the NICS should contact the vacancy holder to check if they will honour your continuous service.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your transfer</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Make sure you understand the terms of your transfer in full, including any effect on your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<p class="govuk-body">Check how your performance award/bonus will be paid if this applies. Speak to your current manager, then your new manager to find out.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You will get an employment contract on or before your start date. If you do not, contact your line manager. You keep employment rights related to length of service. For example, annual leave and pension.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Systems and processes</h2> 
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Your current departmentâ€™s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your current department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>following the process and providing accurate information to your new department with one calendar month notice. This allows for your transfer with minimal disruption to you and the department.</li>
<li>releasing you to your new role within 4-8 weeks. Excluding time taken to complete any vetting needed.</li>
<li>paying you until the day before you transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If your transfer date is the first of the month, you should avoid any overpayments. These include non-recoverable aspects, for example increased:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advice on pre-employment checks and security clearance</h2> 
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Pre-employment checks</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">All staff transferring from other departments undergo some pre-employment checks. These are known as Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks. Some departments also refer to them as â€˜basicâ€™ or â€˜baselineâ€™ checks.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">They help departments follow legislation to provide evidence of right to work, including:<p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>your right to work in the UK</li></li>
<li>your right to work in the Civil Service</li>
<li>your nationality and immigration status</li>
<li>an identity check</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Basic, standard or enhanced criminal record checks may be needed.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The job advert should confirm the level of checking needed for the role. If you are not sure, check with your vacancy holder.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">National Security Vetting</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">You may need NSV for the role you are transferring to. The <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> page on GOV.UK explains the different levels in detail.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you transfer to a role with the same level of NSV or higher</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you have clearance at the same level or higher it will normally transfer to your new department. Your new department is responsible for the transfer of NSV. They will ask you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>about the transfer of your clearance (if it applies)</li>
<li>to complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you do not have the same or higher level of NSV, you will need a new NSV check. You cannot agree your start date until after this is done.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will tell you which checks you need.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">To find out more you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>ask the vacancy holder</li>
<li>check the job advert</li>
<li>contact your vetting authority/cluster security unit</li>
<li>check your departmentâ€™s intranet for more information</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Student loans</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are repaying a student loan, you may do this through a deduction from your salary.</p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pay and allowances</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your current department will pay you until your last working day with them. If this is at the end of the week it will be a Sunday. Your new department will pay you from your first working day with them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring permanently</li>
<li>on a loan of more than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">your new departmentâ€™s pay and reward policies will apply.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will confirm your basic pay. Individual departments are responsible for pay decisions.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Allowances</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer or move on loan to a new department, allowances are not automatically kept. They are not consolidated into base pay. Your new department will decide on allowances payable to you following your transfer. Payment of an allowance may include:</p>

<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will make sure job adverts state relevant allowances for the role. If your new role does not have a specialist pay range or allowance, you will lose any existing specialist pay or allowances.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If allowances are kept or agreed as part of your job offer, these will be reviewed by your new department. The departmentâ€™s pay, allowance and mark time policies could have an effect on these. If you are not sure, speak to your new line manager.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Departments have different location pay areas. You may not receive the same location pay or allowance, even if your location stays the same.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Performance awards</h3>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">End of year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer after your pay award is agreed, your old department will honour the payment. Departments keep payroll open for 6 months after transfers. so they can process any outstanding payments.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You should not receive two performance awards for the same period.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">In-year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">Outstanding in-year awards, either a voucher or cash award, should be paid before you transfer. If this is not possible, your old department should pay in-year awards to you within 3 months of the award date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The effect of under or overpayment</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">To avoid any payroll or tax issues, it is strongly advised to agree a start date of the first of the month.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If your old department is not told to remove you from payroll in time, you may be overpaid. You should consider payroll cut off dates and your start date when you move departments. Speak to your HR team to understand payroll cutoff dates.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are overpaid, do not spend this money. You will need to pay it back in a lump sum after tax. You should not feel any effect on your take home pay.</p> 
<p cass="govuk-body">Your old department will contact you to recover any overpayment. This will be the salary for the time you did not work for them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If returning the overpayment creates a particular hardship, contact your old department immediately. In extreme circumstances they may be able to support a gradual repayment.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you notice any issues with your pay, raise this immediately.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Overpayment example</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The transfer of your HR record was completed after you started in your new department.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You transferred to your new department in January 2022. Your old shared services/HR team were only told in March 2022 so your old department overpaid you by 2 months.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">When the overpayment ends, your old department contacts you to request you repay this. You should immediately repay the net figure to your old department.</p>
