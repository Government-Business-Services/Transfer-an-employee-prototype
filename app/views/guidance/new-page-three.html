        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">General principles of the staff transfer process: information for employees</h1>
<p class="govuk-body-l">This page for employees explains the detail behind the staff transfer process, and what you need to do to change departments in the Civil Service.</p>
<br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="eligibility">Eligibility</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">All civil servants recruited through <a href="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/" class="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/">fair and open competition</a> can apply for, or be considered for a staff transfer on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a level grade</li>
<li>a lower grade</li>
<li>promotion</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Also eligible to apply:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>employees in crown non-departmental public bodies</li>
<li>employees in accredited non-crown, non-departmental public bodies (accredited by the Civil Service Commission)</li>
<li>employees transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) and the Scottish and Welsh governments</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees transferring to the NICS should contact the vacancy holder to check if they will honour your continuous service.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l" id="probation">Probationary periods</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">If you are on a probationary period, the job advert should clarify eligibility to transfer. If you are not sure if you are eligible, contact your HR Business Partner.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="yours">Your transfer</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Make sure you understand the terms of your transfer in full, including any effect on your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>allowances</li>
  <li>annual leave allowance</li>
  <li>entitlement to occupational maternity/paternity pay</li>
  <li>payments into any childcare voucher scheme</li>
  <li>pension contributions</li>
  <li>performance award/bonus</li>
  <li>salary</li>
  <li>terms and conditions of employment</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Refer to your job advert or check with your vacancy holder for more details about terms and conditions. Remember, your current department will pay you until your last working day with them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Check how your performance award/bonus will be paid if this applies. Speak to your current manager, then your new manager to find out.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You will get an employment contract on or before your start date. If you do not, contact your line manager or HR team. You keep employment rights related to length of service. For example, annual leave and pension.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="WPA">Workplace adjustments</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Workplace adjustments are changes to remove or reduce disadvantages in the workplace. They can be physical or non-physical changes to help employees.  They are sometimes known as reasonable adjustments. Any agreed adjustments should be recorded in a Workplace Adjustment Passport. This should be up-to-date and agreed.</p> 
<p class="govuk-body">Your workplace adjustments might be known as ‘hard’ adjustments. For example, a chair, desk, or specialist computer software. ‘Soft’ adjustments may include: 
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>changes to your start and finish times</li>
  <li>how you are allowed travel when on duty</li>
  <li>large print, braille or other formatting changes</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Share and discuss your current Workplace Adjustment Passport with your new line manager. This should help make sure the adjustments you need are in place for your start date. If your new department needs to order items to meet your needs, this may take time. This should be considered when agreeing your start date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">If you have hard adjustments</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your current line manager decides which hard adjustments can transfer. Specialist chairs, footrests or other equipment should transfer instead of ordering new ones. For all adjustments, they will consider:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>cost effectiveness of transferring where buying new may be cheaper</li>
  <li>compatibility of software or IT equipment</li>  
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If you have any hard adjustments which cannot transfer, your current manager should tell your new department. The new department should buy any equipment to meet your needs in time for your start date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">If you have soft adjustments</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your new line manager should discuss any current soft adjustments with you. They should consider if these are necessary in your new role. Some soft adjustments may be specific to the role. For example, a later start time was agreed in your current role. In your new role this could be later as standard.</p> 
<br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="systems">Systems and processes</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Your current department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body"current_dept">Your current department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>following the process and providing accurate information to your new department with one calendar month notice. This allows for your transfer with minimal disruption to you and the department.</li>
<li>releasing you to your new role within 4-8 weeks. Excluding time taken to complete any vetting needed.</li>
<li>paying you until the day before you transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If your transfer date is the first of the month, you should avoid any overpayments. These include non-recoverable aspects, for example increased:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>student loan payments</li>
<li>pension payments</li>
<li>national insurance payments</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Your new department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your new department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>completing your pre-employment checks</li>
<li>transfer of any valid security clearance</li>
<li>completing a new security clearance request if applicable</li>
<li>making sure you have a staff number and start date</li>
<li>setting up your HR record and paying you from your start date</li>
</ul>
<br>                                         
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="pre-employment">Advice on pre-employment checks and security clearance</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Pre-employment checks</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">All staff transferring from other departments undergo some pre-employment checks. These are known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels#baseline-personnel-security-standard-bpss" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels#baseline-personnel-security-standard-bpss">Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</a> checks. Some departments also refer to them as ‘basic’ or ‘baseline’ checks.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">They help departments follow legislation to provide evidence of right to work, including:<p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>your right to work in the UK</li>
<li>your right to work in the Civil Service</li>
<li>your nationality and immigration status</li>
<li>an identity check</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Basic, standard or enhanced criminal record checks may be needed. Depending on your new role, you may need additional checks, for example:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>relationships with current prisoners</li>
  <li>safeguarding checks to work with children or vulnerable adults</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body"This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The job advert should confirm the level of checking needed for the role. If you are not sure, check with your vacancy holder.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l" id="NSV">National Security Vetting</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">In addition to BPSS checks, some roles need National Security Vetting (NSV), sometimes called security clearance:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>Counter Terrorist Check (CTC)</li>
  <li>Security Check (SC)</li>
  <li>enhanced Security Check (eSC)</li>
  <li>Developed Vetting (DV)</li>
  <li>enhanced Developed Vetting (eDV)</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">These are mandatory for certain job roles and locations. If you hold a National Security Vetting (NSV) clearance level or you need one for your new role, this is part of your transfer.  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> explains the different levels in detail.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">NSV sits with you, not your role.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you have a valid NSV, it will be transferable if the expiry date is longer than 3 months. This is unless there is a risk flag or issue with the transfer.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You will be told if the transfer of your NSV will take more than 7 days. For example, active after care is present or NSV is not found.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You should <strong>always</strong> complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form. Only complete the NSV section if:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>your new role needs NSV - regardless of your current clearance</li>
  <li>you have valid NSV clearance - regardless of level, even if your new role does not need NSV clearance</li>
</ul> 
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l" id="same_or_higher">If you transfer to a role with the same level of NSV or higher</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you have clearance at the same level or higher it will normally transfer to your new department. Your new department is responsible for the transfer of NSV. They will ask you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>about the transfer of your clearance (if it applies)</li>
  <li>to complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form</li>
</ul>   
<p cass="govuk-body">If you do not have the same or higher level of NSV, you will need a new NSV check. You cannot agree your start date until after this is done.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will tell you which checks you need. To find out more you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>ask the vacancy holder</li>
  <li>check the job advert</li>
  <li>contact your vetting authority/cluster security unit</li>
  <li>check your department’s intranet for more information</li>
</ul> 
<br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l" id="student">Student loans</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are repaying a student loan, you may do this through a deduction from your salary.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring to a new department and you have a student loan, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/which-repayment-plan-you-are-on" class="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/which-repayment-plan-you-are-on">repaying your student loan</a> explains the different repayment plans.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="pay">Pay and allowances</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your current department will pay you until your last working day with them. If this is at the end of the week it will be a Sunday. Your new department will pay you from your first working day with them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring permanently</li>
<li>on a loan of more than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">your new department’s pay and reward policies will apply.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will confirm your basic pay. Individual departments are responsible for pay decisions.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Level transfers</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring at the same grade, your basic pay will normally stay the same. Excluding:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
<li>location allowances</li>
<li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l">Example 1</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">Your current basic pay is below the minimum of the new department’s pay range. Your new department will put you on the minimum basic pay for their grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l">Example 2</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">Your basic pay is above the maximum of the new department’s pay range after level transfer. Your new department will put you on their maximum basic pay for your grade.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The new department's mark time pay policy will decide if the amount above the maximum pay range will be:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>lost</li>
<li>paid on a mark time basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>                                           
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Promotion</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring on promotion, your basic pay will not normally include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
<li>location allowances</li>
<li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l">Example 1</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You are transferring on promotion. Your current pay is below the maximum basic pay for the grade. You may:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>move to the bottom of the new grade pay scale</li>
<li>receive a per cent increase in basic pay (usually 10%)</li>
</ul>
   <p cass="govuk-body">whichever would be more.</p>
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l">Example 2</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You are transferring on promotion. Your basic pay is above the maximum of the new department’s pay range. The new department will place you on their maximum basic pay for the grade.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The new department’s mark time policy will determine if the amount above the maximum pay range will be:</p>
   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>lost</li>
<li>paid on a mark time basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Allowances</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer or move on loan to a new department, allowances are not automatically kept. They are not consolidated into base pay. Your new department will decide on allowances payable to you following your transfer. Payment of an allowance may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>location</li>
<li>specialist professions or skills</li>
<li>unsocial hours</li>
<li>recruitment and retention</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will make sure job adverts state relevant allowances for the role. If your new role does not have a specialist pay range or allowance, you will lose any existing specialist pay or allowances.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If allowances are kept or agreed as part of your job offer, these will be reviewed by your new department. The department’s pay, allowance and mark time policies could have an effect on these. If you are not sure, speak to your new line manager.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Departments have different location pay areas. You may not receive the same location pay or allowance, even if your location stays the same.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Performance awards</h3>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-l">End of year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer after your pay award is agreed, your old department will honour the payment. Departments keep payroll open for 6 months after transfers. so they can process any outstanding payments.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You should not receive two performance awards for the same period.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-l>In-year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">Outstanding in-year awards, either a voucher or cash award, should be paid before you transfer. If this is not possible, your old department should pay in-year awards to you within 3 months of the award date.</p>
<br>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-l">Loans</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">The staff transfer process applies to employees on a loan of more than 6 months. It does not apply to short term loans of less than 6 months where there is no movement of payroll.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/loans-policy-combined-hr-and-finance-policy-and-process" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-for-civil-servants-how-to-move-jobs-between-departments-and-agencies/loans-policy-combined-hr-and-finance-policy-and-process">loans policy guidance</a> explains HR and financial implications to make decisions on loans easier for everyone. It includes details for loans of more than 6 months, and short term loans. If you have further queries about loans, contact your HR team or HR business partner.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="under_and_overpayment">The effect of under or overpayment</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">To avoid any payroll or tax issues, it is strongly advised to agree a start date of the first of the month.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If your old department is not told to remove you from payroll in time, you may be overpaid. You should consider payroll cut off dates and your start date when you move departments. Speak to your HR team to understand payroll cutoff dates.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are overpaid, do not spend this money. You will need to pay it back in a lump sum after tax. You should not feel any effect on your take home pay.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your old department will contact you to recover any overpayment. This will be the salary for the time you did not work for them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If returning the overpayment creates a particular hardship, contact your old department immediately. In extreme circumstances they may be able to support a gradual repayment.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you notice any issues with your pay, raise this immediately.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-l">Overpayment example</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The transfer of your HR record was completed after you started in your new department.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You transferred to your new department in January 2022. Your old shared services/HR team were only told in March 2022 so your old department overpaid you by 2 months.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">When the overpayment ends, your old department contacts you to request you repay this. You should immediately repay the net figure to your old department.</p>
