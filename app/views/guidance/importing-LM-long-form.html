        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">How to move roles across the Civil Service: guidance for importing managers</h1>
        <p class="govuk-body-l">This guidance explains the staff transfer process for importing line managers. It explains what you need to do to support staff transfers in the Civil Service.</p>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m" id="who">Who does the staff transfer process apply to?</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">It applies to civil servants who are moving between:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>departments</li>
<li>arm’s length bodies (ALBs)</li>
<li>non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) employing civil servants</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">and civil servants:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)</li>
  <li>whose original appointment was on merit and by <a href="#" class="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/">fair and open competition</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="how">How do employees transfer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee will get an email confirming a provisional job offer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They should then complete the <a href="#" class="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/997207/Civil_Service_Employee_Transfer_Form__9.xlsx">staff transfer form</a>. This is otherwise known as the Civil Service Employee Transfer (CSET) form. It covers HR, payroll and security clearance transfer. Their current line manager and HR/shared services also have sections of the form to complete.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer process puts the employee at the centre of the process. They are responsible for starting the transfer. The employee provides most of the information needed to progress their transfer. This includes personal details and information about both their current and new role. </p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are actions for importing line managers/vacancy holders transferring an employee into their department. You should make sure the employee joins your department’s payroll by providing:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>security confirmation</li>
  <li>start date</li>
  <li>salary</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">To onboard the employee you must also complete the New Entrant Notification (NEN) form as quickly as possible. Some departments call this the joiner form or Net Sheet.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Exceptions</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer form is mandatory except for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>machinery of government changes</li>
  <li>Cabinet Office statement of practice (COSOP) moves</li>
  <li>if a NDPB employs public servants or you are a public servant</li>
  <li>loans of less than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="NSV">National Security Vetting (NSV)</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee holds a National Security Vetting (NSV) clearance level or they need one for their new role, this is part of the transfer process.</p> <p class="govuk-body">NSV is sometimes called security clearance. It sits with the employee, not their role. <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> explains the different levels of checks and which ones employees may need depending on their role.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If they have a valid NSV, it will be transferable if the expiry date is longer than 3 months, unless there is a risk flag or issue with the transfer.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee will be told if the NSV transfer will take more than 7 days. For example, if active after care is present or NSV is not found.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee should <strong>always</strong> complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form. They should only complete the NSV section if:</p>
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>their new role needs NSV - regardless of your current clearance</li>
  <li>they have valid NSV clearance - regardless of level, even if their new role does not need NSV clearance</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pre-employment checks</h2>
           <p class="govuk-body">The employee's new role may need them to have pre-employment checks. This could include checks on:</p>
                   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li><a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/government-baseline-personnel-security-standard">Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS)</a></li>
  <li>relationships with current prisoners</li>
  <li>safeguarding checks to work with children or vulnerable adults</li>
</ul>
        <p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
</br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="steps">Steps in the staff transfer process</h2>
<p class="govuk-body>This section explains the steps to complete a staff transfer. Some steps in the transfer process are specific to the importing department. You should follow these steps and check your department’s internal guidance. This is because some departments may share actions between other teams.<p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 1: The employee accepts a provisional job offer in your department</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>The employee should follow the instructions in the emailed job offer.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 2: The employee fills in security clearance information in Part A-1 of the staff transfer form</h3>
                           <p class="govuk-body">You need the information from Part A-1 to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>transfer any current and valid security clearance</li>
  <li>start any new baseline personnel security standard (BPSS) and security clearance needed</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee's security clearance will be transferable unless there is a risk flag or an issue with the transfer.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 3: The employee shares their salary information and submits Part A-1</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee sends Part A-1 to you unless your department has instructed otherwise.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They will also send their 2 most recent payslips for you to calculate their new salary. Contact the employee if you have not received their payslips within 4 working days.</p>                          
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 4: Your department carries out BPSS checks</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">It is your department’s responsibility to carry out BPSS checks, including essential checks on the employee’s:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>identity</li>
  <li>right to work in the UK</li>
  <li>right to work in the Civil Service</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Some departments do this at interview, but they will not repeat the checks at this stage.</p>y
<p class="govuk-body">You should use the information contained in the employee’s Part A-1 to start any required checks.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee has current valid NSV:</p>   
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>you will need to start a transfer of this security clearance with your vetting authority/security cluster</li>
</ul>  
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee needs a higher level of NSV than they currently hold:</p>   
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>you will need to start a new security clearance check</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">You need to respond to any additional requests from your vetting authority. This prevents delays to the transfer of security clearance.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If the employee has not had a Criminal Records check in the last 5 years you should arrange a new one.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Following successful transfer of security clearance</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">Departments should consider any physical or mental medical conditions that may lead to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>incapacity</li>
  <li>loss or alteration of consciousness</li>
</ul> 
<p class="govuk-body">and reflect upon the employee's suitability for the role.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 5: You agree a start date</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You agree a start date with the employee and their current manager.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Do not do this until:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>BPSS checks are complete</li>
  <li>any NSV clearance the employee needs is complete or transferred</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">It is strongly advised to <strong>agree a start date on the first of the month</strong>. Otherwise, this will have an effect on the employee's pay.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee should move to your department <strong>before</strong> your payroll cut-off. Even if their start date cannot be the first of the month.</p> 
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">If you arrange a start date after your payroll cut-off</h4>
<p class="govuk-body">You should support the employee with an emergency payment. They will no longer be on their old department’s payroll.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The employee should not resign when transferring from their old department. This will affect their pension.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 6: You confirm the employee’s salary and start date</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Following completion of pre-employment checks and relevant security clearance, you should send the employee confirmation of their new salary and start date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 7: Complete Part A-2 of the staff transfer form</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">This may vary by department. This could include the New Entrant Notification (NEN) form or other departmental onboarding form. It may be known as the RMG42, NET sheet or Joiner Information. This allows the employee to join your department and be added to your payroll.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">It is your responsibility to make sure the vacancy ID and employee’s name are included in the email subject field.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If you do not complete this step the employee will not be added to payroll or receive their IT equipment.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 8: The employee completes Part A-2 of the staff transfer form</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>You should tell the employee to complete Part A-2 of the staff transfer form. They send Parts A-1 and A-2 to their current manager to progress their transfer.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 9: The exporting manager completes Part B of the staff transfer form</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>They will review the employee’s answers to Parts A1 and A2.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>The exporting manager completes Part B and sends the updated form to their HR/Shared Services within 2 working days to start the offboarding process. The employee should receive a copy. </p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Timing</h4>
<p class='govuk-body'>The form should be sent to exporting HR/Shared Services at least 1 month before the employee’s transfer date. If the form is submitted with less than 1 month’s notice, this can have an effect on the employee’s pay. A start date on the first of the month should still be agreed where possible.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 10: The exporting HR/Shared Services team complete Part C</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>They then send the completed form to the importing department’s HR/Shared Services team.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>The employee should chase their current HR/Shared Services if they have not done this within 5 days. Processing times can vary between departments.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 11: The employee’s HR/payroll record is set up on your payroll</h3>
<p class='govuk-body'>Your HR/Shared Services receive the completed onboarding form and staff transfer form. The employee will be set up with a new employee number and HR record to make sure they are paid.</p>
<p class='govuk-body'>If the employee’s pay is wrong when they start their new role, they should raise the issue with you or your Shared Services/HR team. If they need to, they should escalate it to their HR Business Partner.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Step 12: The employee joins your department to start their new role</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">You will need to consider if the employee needs:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>a loan agreement in place (if this applies)
  <li>an induction pack</li>
  <li>training or equipment needed for their new role</li>
  <li>any reasonable workplace adjustments</li>
  <li>any assistive technology, for example screen reading software</li>
  <li>to complete any mandatory training</li>
</ul>   
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you need help with the staff transfer process</h4>                                   
<p class="govuk-body">If you are an importing manager and need further help, contact your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>line manager</li>
  <li>recruitment provider (if applicable)</li>
  <li>vacancy holder (if different from yourself),/li>
  <li>HR team/Shared Services</li>
  <li>HR Business Partner</li>

<br>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l>Transfers information for vacancy holders</h2>                
<p class="govuk-body">You should agree a date for the employee to start in your department on the <strong>first of the month</strong>. If you do not, the employee will have problems with their pay</p>
<p class="govuk-body">If this is not possible then best practice is to move before payroll cut-off. Check the list of payroll cut-off dates in the staff transfer form when deciding a start date.</p>	If this is not possible then best practice is to move <strong>before payroll cut-off</strong>. Check the list of payroll cut-off dates in the staff transfer form when deciding a start date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Salary implications of mid-month moves</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Where a first of the month transfer is not possible, employees will have pay issues. HMRC will assume the employee has two employers, so the employee will be taxed twice.</p>		     		     
<h2 class="govuk-heading-l" id="principles">General principles and further information</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX</p>                                        
<p class="govuk-body">This section explains detail behind the staff transfer process.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Eligibility</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">All civil servants recruited through open and fair competition can apply for, or be considered for a staff transfer on:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>a level grade</li>
<li>a lower grade</li>
<li>promotion</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">Also eligible to apply:</p>

<li>employees in accredited non-crown NDPBs (accredited by the Civil Service Commission)</li>
<li>employees transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS)</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If you are on a probationary period, the job advert should clarify eligibility to transfer. If you are not sure if you are eligible, contact your HR Business Partner.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Employees transferring to the NICS should contact the vacancy holder to check if they will honour your continuous service.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Your transfer</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">Make sure you understand the terms of your transfer in full, including any effect on your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>allowances</li>
<li>annual leave allowance</li>
<li>entitlement to occupational maternity/paternity pay</li>

</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Refer to your job advert or check with your vacancy holder for more details about terms and conditions. Remember, your current department will pay you until your last working day with them.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">Check how your performance award/bonus will be paid if this applies. Speak to your current manager, then your new manager to find out.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">You will get an employment contract on or before your start date. If you do not, contact your line manager. You keep employment rights related to length of service. For example, annual leave and pension.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Systems and processes</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Your current department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your current department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>following the process and providing accurate information to your new department with one calendar month notice. This allows for your transfer with minimal disruption to you and the department.</li>
<li>releasing you to your new role within 4-8 weeks. Excluding time taken to complete any vetting needed.</li>
<li>paying you until the day before you transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If your transfer date is the first of the month, you should avoid any overpayments. These include non-recoverable aspects, for example increased:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>student loan payments</li>
<li>pension payments</li>
<li>national insurance payments</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Your new department’s responsibilities</h3>

<li>transfer of any valid security clearance</li>
<li>completing a new security clearance request if applicable</li>
<li>making sure you have a staff number and start date</li>
<li>setting up your HR record and paying you from your start date</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advice on pre-employment checks and security clearance</h2>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Pre-employment checks</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">All staff transferring from other departments undergo some pre-employment checks. These are known as Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks. Some departments also refer to them as ‘basic’ or ‘baseline’ checks.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">They help departments follow legislation to provide evidence of right to work, including:<p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>your right to work in the UK</li>
<li>your right to work in the Civil Service</li>
<li>your nationality and immigration status</li>
<li>an identity check</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Basic, standard or enhanced criminal record checks may be needed.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The job advert should confirm the level of checking needed for the role. If you are not sure, check with your vacancy holder.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">National Security Vetting</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">You may need NSV for the role you are transferring to. The <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> page on GOV.UK explains the different levels in detail.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">If you transfer to a role with the same level of NSV or higher</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you have clearance at the same level or higher it will normally transfer to your new department. Your new department is responsible for the transfer of NSV. They will ask you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>about the transfer of your clearance (if it applies)</li>
<li>to complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you do not have the same or higher level of NSV, you will need a new NSV check. You cannot agree your start date until after this is done.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will tell you which checks you need.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">To find out more you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>ask the vacancy holder</li>
<li>check the job advert</li>
<li>contact your vetting authority/cluster security unit</li>
<li>check your department’s intranet for more information</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Student loans</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are repaying a student loan, you may do this through a deduction from your salary.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring to a new department and you have a student loan, the <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/which-repayment-plan-you-are-on">repaying your student loan</a> page on GOV.UK explains the different repayment plans.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pay and allowances</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your current department will pay you until your last working day with them. If this is at the end of the week it will be a Sunday. Your new department will pay you from your first working day with them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring permanently</li>
<li>on a loan of more than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">your new department’s pay and reward policies will apply.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will confirm your basic pay. Individual departments are responsible for pay decisions.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Level transfers</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring at the same grade, your basic pay will normally stay the same. Excluding:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
<li>location allowances</li>
<li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1</h4>

</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Promotion</h3>

  <p cass="govuk-body">The new department’s mark time policy will determine if the amount above the maximum pay range will be:</p>
   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>lost</li>
<li>paid on a mark time basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Allowances</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer or move on loan to a new department, allowances are not automatically kept. They are not consolidated into base pay. Your new department will decide on allowances payable to you following your transfer. Payment of an allowance may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>location</li>
<li>specialist professions or skills</li>
<li>unsocial hours</li>
<li>recruitment and retention</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will make sure job adverts state relevant allowances for the role. If your new role does not have a specialist pay range or allowance, you will lose any existing specialist pay or allowances.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If allowances are kept or agreed as part of your job offer, these will be reviewed by your new department. The department’s pay, allowance and mark time policies could have an effect on these. If you are not sure, speak to your new line manager.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Departments have different location pay areas. You may not receive the same location pay or allowance, even if your location stays the same.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Performance awards</h3>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">End of year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer after your pay award is agreed, your old department will honour the payment. Departments keep payroll open for 6 months after transfers. so they can process any outstanding payments.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You should not receive two performance awards for the same period.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-s">In-year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">Outstanding in-year awards, either a voucher or cash award, should be paid before you transfer. If this is not possible, your old department should pay in-year awards to you within 3 months of the award date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The effect of under or overpayment</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">To avoid any payroll or tax issues, it is strongly advised to agree a start date of the first of the month.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If your old department is not told to remove you from payroll in time, you may be overpaid. You should consider payroll cut off dates and your start date when you move departments. Speak to your HR team to understand payroll cutoff dates.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are overpaid, do not spend this money. You will need to pay it back in a lump sum after tax. You should not feel any effect on your take home pay.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your old department will contact you to recover any overpayment. This will be the salary for the time you did not work for them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If returning the overpayment creates a particular hardship, contact your old department immediately. In extreme circumstances they may be able to support a gradual repayment.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you notice any issues with your pay, raise this immediately.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Overpayment example</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The transfer of your HR record was completed after you started in your new department.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You transferred to your new department in January 2022. Your old shared services/HR team were only told in March 2022 so your old department overpaid you by 2 months.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">When the overpayment ends, your old department contacts you to request you repay this. You should immediately repay the net figure to your old department.</p>
