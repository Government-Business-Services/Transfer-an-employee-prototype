<p class="govuk-body">You will get an employment contract on or before your start date. If you do not, contact your line manager. You keep employment rights related to length of service. For example, annual leave and pension.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Systems and processes</h2> 
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your current department’s responsibilities</h3>
<p class="govuk-body">Your current department is responsible for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>following the process and providing accurate information to your new department with one calendar month notice. This allows for your transfer with minimal disruption to you and the department.</li>
<li>releasing you to your new role within 4-8 weeks. Excluding time taken to complete any vetting needed.</li>
<li>paying you until the day before you transfer.</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">If your transfer date is the first of the month, you should avoid any overpayments. These include non-recoverable aspects, for example increased:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>student loan payments</li>
<li>pension payments</li>
<li>national insurance payments</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Your new department’s responsibilities</h3>

<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>completing your pre-employment checks</li>
<li>transfer of any valid security clearance</li>

</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Advice on pre-employment checks and security clearance</h2> 
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Pre-employment checks</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">All staff transferring from other departments undergo some pre-employment checks. These are known as Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) checks. Some departments also refer to them as ‘basic’ or ‘baseline’ checks.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">They help departments follow legislation to provide evidence of right to work, including:<p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>your right to work in the UK</li></li>
<li>your right to work in the Civil Service</li>
<li>your nationality and immigration status</li>
<li>an identity check</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Basic, standard or enhanced criminal record checks may be needed.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">The job advert should confirm the level of checking needed for the role. If you are not sure, check with your vacancy holder.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">National Security Vetting (NSV)</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">You may need NSV for the role you are transferring to. The <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/united-kingdom-security-vetting-clearance-levels/national-security-vetting-clearance-levels">National security vetting: clearance levels</a> page on GOV.UK explains the different levels in detail.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">If you transfer to a role with the same level of NSV or higher</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you have clearance at the same level or higher it will normally transfer to your new department. Your new department is responsible for the transfer of NSV. They will ask you:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>about the transfer of your clearance (if it applies)</li>
<li>to complete part A-1 of the staff transfer form</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you do not have the same or higher level of NSV, you will need a new NSV check. You cannot agree your start date until after this is done.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will tell you which checks you need.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">To find out more you can:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>ask the vacancy holder</li>
<li>check the job advert</li>
<li>contact your vetting authority/cluster security unit</li>
<li>check your department’s intranet for more information</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Student loans</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are repaying a student loan, you may do this through a deduction from your salary.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring to a new department and you have a student loan, the <a href="#" class="https://www.gov.uk/repaying-your-student-loan/which-repayment-plan-you-are-on">repaying your student loan</a> page on GOV.UK explains the different repayment plans.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Pay and allowances</h2>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your current department will pay you until your last working day with them. If this is at the end of the week it will be a Sunday. Your new department will pay you from your first working day with them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>transferring permanently</li>
<li>on a loan of more than 6 months</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">your new department’s pay and reward policies will apply.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will confirm your basic pay. Individual departments are responsible for pay decisions.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Level transfers</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring at the same grade, your basic pay will normally stay the same. Excluding:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
<li>location allowances</li>
<li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">Your current basic pay is below the minimum of the new department’s pay range. Your new department will put you on the minimum basic pay for their grade.</p>
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 2</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">Your basic pay is above the maximum of the new department’s pay range after level transfer. Your new department will put you on their maximum basic pay for your grade.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The new department's mark time pay policy will decide if the amount above the maximum pay range will be:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>lost</li>
<li>paid on a mark time basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Promotion</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are transferring on promotion, your basic pay will not normally include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>specialist pay or allowances</li>
<li>location allowances</li>
<li>unsocial hours payments</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">This list is not exhaustive.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 1</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You are transferring on promotion. Your current pay is below the maximum basic pay for the grade. You may:</p>
  <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>move to the bottom of the new grade pay scale</li>
<li>receive a per cent increase in basic pay (usually 10%)</li>
</ul>
   <p cass="govuk-body">whichever would be more.</p> 
</div>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Example 2</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You are transferring on promotion. Your basic pay is above the maximum of the new department’s pay range. The new department will place you on their maximum basic pay for the grade.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The new department’s mark time policy will determine if the amount above the maximum pay range will be:</p>
   <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>lost</li>
<li>paid on a mark time basis</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Allowances</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer or move on loan to a new department, allowances are not automatically kept. They are not consolidated into base pay. Your new department will decide on allowances payable to you following your transfer. Payment of an allowance may include:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet"></p>
<li>location</li>
<li>specialist professions or skills</li>
<li>unsocial hours</li>
<li>recruitment and retention</li>
</ul>
<p cass="govuk-body">Your new department will make sure job adverts state relevant allowances for the role. If your new role does not have a specialist pay range or allowance, you will lose any existing specialist pay or allowances.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If allowances are kept or agreed as part of your job offer, these will be reviewed by your new department. The department’s pay, allowance and mark time policies could have an effect on these. If you are not sure, speak to your new line manager.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">Departments have different location pay areas. You may not receive the same location pay or allowance, even if your location stays the same.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Performance awards</h3>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">End of year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you transfer after your pay award is agreed, your old department will honour the payment. Departments keep payroll open for 6 months after transfers. so they can process any outstanding payments.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">You should not receive two performance awards for the same period.</p>
<h4 class="govuk-heading-m">In-year performance award</h4>
<p cass="govuk-body">Outstanding in-year awards, either a voucher or cash award, should be paid before you transfer. If this is not possible, your old department should pay in-year awards to you within 3 months of the award date.</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">The effect of under or overpayment</h3>
<p cass="govuk-body">To avoid any payroll or tax issues, it is strongly advised to agree a start date of the first of the month.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If your old department is not told to remove you from payroll in time, you may be overpaid. You should consider payroll cut off dates and your start date when you move departments. Speak to your HR team to understand payroll cutoff dates.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you are overpaid, do not spend this money. You will need to pay it back in a lump sum after tax. You should not feel any effect on your take home pay.</p> 
<p cass="govuk-body">Your old department will contact you to recover any overpayment. This will be the salary for the time you did not work for them.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If returning the overpayment creates a particular hardship, contact your old department immediately. In extreme circumstances they may be able to support a gradual repayment.</p>
<p cass="govuk-body">If you notice any issues with your pay, raise this immediately.</p>
<div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Overpayment example</h4>
  <p cass="govuk-body">The transfer of your HR record was completed after you started in your new department.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">You transferred to your new department in January 2022. Your old shared services/HR team were only told in March 2022 so your old department overpaid you by 2 months.</p>
  <p cass="govuk-body">When the overpayment ends, your old department contacts you to request you repay this. You should immediately repay the net figure to your old department.</p>
