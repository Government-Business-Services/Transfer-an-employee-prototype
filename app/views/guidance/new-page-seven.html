        <p class="govuk-body-l">This guidance for importing line managers explains the process for transferring employees across the Civil Service.</p>
<p class="govuk-body"><a href="https://prototype-training.herokuapp.com/guidance/new-page-one.html" class="https://prototype-training.herokuapp.com/guidance/new-page-one.html">Guidance for employees transferring across the Civil Service</a> and <a href="https://prototype-training.herokuapp.com/guidance/new-page-four-exporting-intro.html" class="https://prototype-training.herokuapp.com/guidance/new-page-four-exporting-intro.html">exporting managers</a> provide an overview of the whole process.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What is a staff transfer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">A lot of employees move across the Civil Service. The staff transfer process helps employees move between government departments without resigning.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer process contains separate actions for:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>transferring employees</li>
	<li>their current line manager</li>
	<li>their current HR/Shared services</li>
	<li>you, as their new line manager</li>
</ul>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer form helps employees progress through their transfer. It collects and shares the information needed for a move between government departments.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who does the staff transfer process apply to?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">It applies to civil servants who are transferring permanently or on a loan of more than 6 months, between:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
<li>departments</li>
<li>arm’s length bodies</li>
<li>non-departmental public bodies employing civil servants</li>
    </ul>
<p class="govuk-body">It also applies to civil servants transferring from the Northern Ireland Civil Service (NICS) and the Scottish and Welsh governments.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">To be eligible, the employee’s original appointment must be on merit and by <a href="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/" class="https://civilservicecommission.independent.gov.uk/recruitment/recruitment-principles/">fair and open competition</a>.</p>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="except">Exceptions</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer form is mandatory except:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/machinery-of-government-changes-information" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/machinery-of-government-changes-information">machinery of government changes</a>. For example, these involve whole business areas transferring between departments.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staff-transfers-in-the-public-sector" class="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/staff-transfers-in-the-public-sector">Cabinet Office statement of practice (COSOP)</a> moves</li>
  <li>public sector workers. For example a teachers, the police or staff employed by a local authority</li>
  <li>employees transferring to a non-departmental public body who does not employ civil servants</li>
  <li>loans of less than 6 months</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="what">How do employees transfer?</h2>
<p class="govuk-body">They will get an email confirming their provisional job offer from the relevant recruitment team.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">They will need to complete Parts A-1 and A-2 of the staff transfer form. This is otherwise known as the Civil Service Employee Transfer (CSET) form. It covers HR, payroll and security clearance transfer. Their current line manager and HR/shared services also have sections of the form to complete.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">The staff transfer process puts the employee at the centre of the process. They are responsible for starting the transfer. The employee provides most of the information needed to progress their transfer. This includes personal details and information about both their current and new role. The employee does not resign when they transfer between departments.</p>
<p class="govuk-body">There are actions for importing line managers/vacancy holders transferring an employee into their department. You should make sure the employee joins your department’s payroll by providing:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
	<li>salary</li>
	<li>start date</li>
	<li>security confirmation</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="support">If you need help with your transfer</h2>        
<p class="govuk-body">If you need help, contact your:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>recruitment provider (if applicable) or HR team/Shared Services</li>
  <li>HR Business Partner</li>
